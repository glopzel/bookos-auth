# Book Tracker

I made a crud app a while ago (bookos or chewbookos), this is the same but has a different architecture and has some nice styling and authentication.

## Tech used

Mongoose/Mongo, Express, EJS, Tailwind + daisy ui, bcrypt, express-flash, express-session, morgan, passport and validator.

## Future plans

- use a book API to get each book cover
- add other strategies for authentication with passport
- rework/improve the code
