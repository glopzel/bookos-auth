# Book Track - Bookos

I made a crud app a while ago (bookos or chewbookos), this is the same but has a different architecture and has some nice styling and authentication.

## Preview

There's no live preview 

## Tech used

Mongoose/Mongo, Express, EJS, Tailwind + daisy ui, bcrypt, express-flash, express-session, morgan, passport and validator.

## Future plans

- use a book API to get the picture of the book image and add it to the card
- rework/improve the code
