# CRUD with MVC

i made a crud app a while ago, this is the same but has a different architecture and has some extra styling. I have yet to add an API to show real books, but this is the core code of it.

There's no live preview 

## Tech used

Mongoose/Mongo, Express, EJS, Materialize CSS

## Future plans

- use a book API to get the picture of the book image and add it to the card
- rework/improve the code
